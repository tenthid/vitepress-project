# Introduction
`Searching` in programming refers to the process of finding a specific item, value, or element within a collection of data. This could be an element in an array, a key in a dictionary, or a record in a database. The efficiency and method of searching can vary based on the type of data structure used and the size of the dataset.

The `primary goal` is to efficiently find a particular element, value, or record based on specified criteria. The objective is to minimize the time and resources needed to find the desired information.
