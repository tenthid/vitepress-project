# Examples of Searching
There are several instances in everyday life where searching techniques in programming can be employed to aid in problem-solving or streamline processes:

::: tip 1. Finding a Recipe in a Cookbook
Imagine you have a cookbook with various recipes. You'd start from the beginning or a particular section and scan through the pages until you find the recipe you want. Similarly, a search algorithm in programming would systematically go through a collection of data (like an array or list) to locate a specific item (in this case, a recipe) by checking each element until it finds the desired one or exhausts the search.

::: tip 2. Searching for a Contact in a Phone Book
Consider searching for a contact in a phone book or contacts list on a phone. You'd start from the beginning or use the alphabetical ordering to quickly navigate to a particular section and scan through the names until you find the contact you're looking for.
