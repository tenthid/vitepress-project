# Project Guide
As a guide, you can utilize several programming concepts for the following:
- `Data types and variables`: to store data, including characters and numbers.
- `String, input, and output`: to prompt user input for menu selection, then verify if the given input meets specified criteria.
- `Arithmetic operators`: involving numeric data and input validation.
- `Selection`: checking a condition to see if it meets certain criteria.
- `Repetition`: looping, for instance, repeating if the input is incorrect.
- `Array`: storing multiple data items.
- `Function`: creating separate functions to be used multiple times within the program.
- `Sorting`: arranging data, such as sorting the data stored in an array.
- `Searching`: performing searches within data stored in an array.

::: tip Optional
If you'd like extra points, you can implement the OOP concepts you've learned earlier.
