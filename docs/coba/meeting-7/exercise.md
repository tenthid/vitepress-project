# Exercise
::: tip What to do?
1. You're building a program to store and manage the scores of students in a class. Initialize a static array to hold scores for 10 students and display the scores of students with odd indices.  
  
2. You have an array that stores temperatures recorded hourly. Initially, the array holds temperatures for 24 hours. Update the temperatures at 2-hour intervals (indices 2, 4, 6, etc.) by increasing each temperature by 2 degrees.  
  
3. Make a simple multidimensional array of 5x4. Then create programs to:  
a. Update one of the values.  
b. Print one of the values.  
c. Print the whole numbers in the array with explanation whether itâ€™s an odd/even number.  
__Example:__  
12 is an even number  
19 is an odd number  
etc.
