# Example Use
`Arrays`, as a concept, are similar to lists or collections of items in our daily lives.
The example is when we have a shopping list.

::: info Shopping List (Array)
1. Eggs
2. Milk
3. Bread
4. Apples
5. Pasta  
  
An array organizes these items in a specific order, just like your list keeps track of what you need to buy in a particular sequence.
