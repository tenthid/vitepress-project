# Introduction
In programming, an `array` is a data structure that allows you to store a collection of items of the same data type. It provides a way to organize data by placing elements in contiguous memory locations, accessible through indices. Arrays are commonly used because they offer efficient storage and easy access to elements.

In the context of arrays, an index refers to the position of an element within the array. It's a numeric value used to uniquely identify each element in the array.
