# Operator Precedence
- `Operator precedence` defines the order in which different operators are evaluated in an expression. It ensures that expressions are computed in a predictable and consistent manner.  
::: tip __Rules__
- __Parentheses:__ Operations within parentheses are evaluated first.  
- __Multiplication and Division:__ These operations have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.  
- __Addition and Subtraction:__ These operations have the next level of precedence.
