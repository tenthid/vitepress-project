# Introducion
Arithmetic in programming refers to the fundamental mathematical operations used to manipulate numerical data within a computer program.  
  
These operations include arithmetic operators such = + (`addition`), - (`subtraction`), * (`multiplication`), / (`division`), and % (`modulo` or remainder) to perform these calculations.
