# Project Making
`Congratulations` on completing 14 sessions of learning programming algorithms! Now it's time to get creative and apply the programming concepts taught in class to build your own project. The goal of this project is to create an algorithm using __pseudocode__, __flowcharts__, and __coding__ in the programming language of your choice (C/C++/Java).

- Meeting 15 -> Think of an idea, make the pseudocode & flowchart
- Meeting 16 -> Time to Code!
