# Examples of Sorting
There are several instances in everyday life where sorting techniques in programming can be employed to aid in problem-solving or streamline processes:  
  
## Online Marketplace Listings
- In e-commerce platforms, sorting algorithms arrange product listings by price, popularity, or user ratings to facilitate easy navigation and enable customers to find desired items efficiently.
 
## Social Media Feed
- Social networks employ sorting algorithms to arrange content in user feeds based on relevance, recency, or engagement metrics, ensuring users view the most pertinent and engaging posts first.
