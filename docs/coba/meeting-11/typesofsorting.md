# Types of Sorting

## Bubble Sort
- Iterates through the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. Repeats this process until the array is sorted.

## Quick Sort
- Chooses a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into smaller subarrays, placing elements smaller than the pivot to its left and elements larger than the pivot to its right. Recursively sorts these subarrays.

## Selection Sort
- Divides the array into sorted and unsorted portions. Finds the smallest element in the unsorted section and swaps it with the first unsorted element. Repeats until the array is sorted.

## Insertion Sort 
- Builds the sorted array one element at a time by iterating through the array and placing each element in its correct position within the sorted portion.
 
## Merge Sort
- Divides the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only one element. Merges these subarrays in sorted order until the entire array is sorted.
 
## Heap Sort
- Builds a heap from the array, rearranging the elements to form a heap data structure. Repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until the array is sorted.
