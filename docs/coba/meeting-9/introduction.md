# Introduction
A `dynamic array` is a data structure that dynamically adjusts its size during execution, unlike a static array which has a fixed size. It allocates memory as needed, allowing for the addition or removal of elements without requiring a predetermined size.  
  
This flexibility enables __efficient memory management__ and __supports operations__ like appending, inserting, or deleting elements while automatically handling memory allocation behind the scenes. Dynamic arrays typically expand in capacity when they reach their limit, ensuring efficient storage and manipulation of data in various programming scenarios.
