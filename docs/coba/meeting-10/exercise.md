2. Write a function named <u>generateRandomNumber</u> that generates and returns a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) without any input. Develop the <u>generateRandomNumber</u> function, then call and print the generated random numbers.
3. Create a function named __calculateArea__ that takes two parameters: length and width of a rectangle. Inside the function, calculate the area using the formula: Area = Length Ã— Width. Then develop the calculateArea function and demonstrate its usage in the main function by providing values for length = 7 and width = 5, then print the calculated area.
4. Write a function named __calculateFactorial__ that takes an integer parameter n. Inside the function, calculate and return the factorial of n. Implement the <u>calculateFactorial</u> function and demonstrate its usage in the main function by calculating the factorial of 6, then print the result.
