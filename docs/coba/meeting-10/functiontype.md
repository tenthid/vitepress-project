# Types of Function
## Built-in Function
These are predefined functions provided by the programming language or libraries. Examples include __print()__ in `Python`, __Math.random()__ in `JavaScript`, or __strlen()__ in `C`. They serve general purposes and are readily available for use. [More about Built-in Function](./builtinfunction).

## User-defined Function
Functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks. They __encapsulate__ __reusable__ blocks of code, enhancing code organization and readability. [More about User-defined Function](./userdefinedfunction.md).
