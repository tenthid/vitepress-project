# Introduction
`Function` are modular blocks of code designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. They encapsulate logic, enabling reuse and abstraction in programming.  
## Purpose
The __purpose__ is to break down complex operations into smaller, more manageable chunks, enhancing readability and maintainability in code.  
## Advantages 
- Code reusability (write once, use multiple times)
- Abstraction (hiding implementation details)
- Improved organization of code
