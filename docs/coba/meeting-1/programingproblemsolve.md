# Problem Solving in Programing
`Problem-solving` refers to the process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving issues or challenges encountered in various situations. It involves using logic, creativity, and systematic approaches to find effective solutions to complex or simple problems.

## Why it's important in programing
Problem-solving in programming is critical as it forms the core of writing code, involving breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps, designing effective solutions, and troubleshooting errors, ultimately leading to efficient and functional software development.

## Steps in Problem Solving
1. Define the Problem
1. Plan the Solution
1. Execute the Solution
1. Evaluate
