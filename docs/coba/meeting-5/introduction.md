# Introduction
`Selection` in programming generally refers to the decision-making process where the program chooses a path or performs a specific action based on certain conditions or criteria.

Like decision-making in daily life, as we decide to take an umbrella if it's raining or wear a coat if it's cold, programs use selection to make choices. Selection in programming enables software to adapt to various inputs, much like how we adapt our actions based on different situations in our daily lives.
