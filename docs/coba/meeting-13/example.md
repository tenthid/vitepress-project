# Example
Letâ€™s take an example of your smartphone!  
  
Imagine you have a "blueprint" for making a smartphone. This "blueprint" lists what should be in a phone: what brand it is, its model, color, how much memory it has, and how big the screen is.  
  
Now, each actual phone is like a printout from this "blueprint". For example, your phone is a printout from that "blueprint". Other phones are too, but they're different colors, brands, and models.  
  
So, the "blueprint" is like a guide that shows what should be in a phone, and the phone you hold is one of the printouts that follows the instructions in that "blueprint".
