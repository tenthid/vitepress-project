# Example
Letâ€™s take an example of your `smartphone`!  
  
Imagine you have a "__blueprint__" for making a smartphone. This "blueprint" lists what should be in a phone: what __brand__ it is, its __model__, __color__, how much __memory__ it has, and how big the screen is.  
  
Now, each actual phone is like a printout from this "blueprint". For example, your phone is a printout from that "blueprint". Other phones are too, but they're different colors, brands, and models.  
  
So, the "blueprint" is like a __guide__ that shows what should be in a phone, and the phone you hold is one of the __printouts__ that follows the instructions in that "blueprint".
