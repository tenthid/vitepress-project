# Final Exercise

::: tip What to do?
Now try to create a class representing anything with a minimum of 3 attributes and __2 methods__. Ensure that the methods have different return types (one void method and the other methods with a different return type).

After that, create 3 objects from that class. Try to display all the attributes and call the methods.
